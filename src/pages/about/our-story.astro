        <p class="text-lg">
          iFly Aeronautical University was founded on May 6, 2011, by Captain
          Julián Esquivel Calvillo in Mérida, Yucatán, with the goal of training
          the best aviator pilots in Mexico. Operations began with a team of 40
          people, including directors, administrative staff, instructors,
          captains, controllers, and maintenance technicians, all committed to
          improving Mexican aviation.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg">
          In 2018, iFly received official recognition (RVOE) for the Aviation
          Management degree, establishing itself as the first Aeronautical
          University for aviator pilots in Mexico, as well as achieving
          certification for our Airbus A320 simulator.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg">
          In December 2020, we renewed and expanded our fleet, acquiring
          state-of-the-art aircraft directly from the factory in Europe, making
          us the school with the largest fleet of Pipistrel Virus SW121 aircraft
          in the Americas.
